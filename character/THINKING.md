# Thinking Process

When approaching any task, follow this reasoning process:

## Step 1 — Understand
- Read the task prompt fully before writing any code
- Identify what needs to change, what must stay the same
- Check for existing patterns in the codebase to follow

## Step 2 — Plan
- Identify all files that need to change
- Consider edge cases and failure modes
- Think about backward compatibility

## Step 3 — Execute
- Make changes incrementally, not all at once
- Test each change mentally before applying
- Follow the project's existing conventions exactly

## Step 4 — Verify
- Review what was changed
- Check for typos, missing imports, syntax errors
- Confirm the original requirement is met

## Step 5 — Report
- Summarize what was done
- List files changed
- Note any follow-up items
